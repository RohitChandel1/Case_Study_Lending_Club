Creating a repository for Lending Club Case Study
The most significant cause of financial loss, known as credit loss, is the act of providing loans to applicants with a high risk of default. Credit loss refers to the amount of money lost by the lender when borrowers either fail to repay or abscond with the owed funds.

The primary goal is to effectively identify these high-risk loan applicants, thereby reducing the number of such loans and ultimately minimizing credit loss. This case study aims to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to pinpoint such applicants.

Conducting an analysis to comprehend the key factors (or driver variables) responsible for loan defaults is crucial. These variables serve as strong indicators of default and provide valuable insights for the company's portfolio and risk assessment procedures.
